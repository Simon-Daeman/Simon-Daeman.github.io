            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>Using descriptive file names in important, because it's easy to loose track of which file is which when you name them all the same.</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. 
             Old image size: 2121x1414-->
            <p>I used simpleimageresizer.com</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The original size of the image was 2121x1412 pixels.</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <p>The original file size was 64 KB, and the new size is 7KB</p>
            <img src="images/html15.jpg" width="2121" height="1414" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass">
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>I used compressor.io to reduce the file size. The original file size was 64 KB</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5_min.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>The compressed image is slightly lower quality, but it's hard to tell because the image is shrunk down.</p>
